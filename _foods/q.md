*Qiū dāo yú* (mackerel pike, Pacific saury, Japanese: sanma, literally: "autumn knife fish") is a fish used in Taiwanese cuisine but most notably in Japanese and Korean cuisines. It is often grilled whole, but can also be deep-fried or braised.

The intestines are very bitter, but many people revere the taste. Renowned Japanese filmmaker Yasujirō Ozu's 1962 film [*An Autumn Afternoon*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Autumn_Afternoon){: target="_blank"} literally translates to "The Taste of Sanma."
